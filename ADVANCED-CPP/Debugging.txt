it is the point where your program breaks

Stepinto
Stepover

are three main things

Console windows:
Autos : to see the memory value
Locals : to see the memory value
Watch4 : to see find the variable in the memory.

we can keep another breakpoint while debugging and press continue to reach to that break point.
