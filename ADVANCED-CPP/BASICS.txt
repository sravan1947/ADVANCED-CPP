 Preprocessors: 

 1. Preprocessors are programs that process our source code before compilation

 2. The source code written by programmers is stored in the file program.cpp.This file is then processed by preprocessors and
    an expanded source code file is generated named program.This expanded file is compiled by the compiler and an object code file 
    is generated named program.obj. Finally,  the linker links this object code file to the object code of the library functions 
    to generate the executable file program.exe.

3. 	#include : the preprocessor will open that file and paste all the code of that file in the included file.

4. #define : the define statement will replace the current text with the new text

5  #if statement will enable or disable the c++ code.

 flow of execution :

 c/c++ program -> (check if preprocessors) (false)---> Compiler (object files)---> Linker (links all the object files) ---> Excutable code
	                |(True)								|
					|->preprocessors perform action ---->

 Visual studio:
  In debug mode Optimization  is set to  disabled 
  In Release mode Optimization is set to Maximum Optimization (Favor Speed) (/O2) 


declaration and defination :

Declaraion : The Function exists or declared but not defined with a body.

Defination : The Funtion is there with it's body.

Linker Error: 
	If the fucntion is Declared but not Defined then, Linker error Arises. 


Compiling: 
	Converts the text file and convert them into object file.(logically it is converting the code into instructions).
